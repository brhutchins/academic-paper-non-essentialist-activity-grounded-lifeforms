\section{Introduction}
In the Aristotelian framework, you get lifeforms for free, as part of the basic ontology. Consequently, you don't need to find something else to which to reduce them. In a mechanistic framework, by contrast, you won't find lifeforms anywhere within the fundamental ontology: you have to build them out of more fundamental entities; whatever a lifeform is, it's going to have to be reducible to something else. The obvious place to look for a reductionist account is morphology.
