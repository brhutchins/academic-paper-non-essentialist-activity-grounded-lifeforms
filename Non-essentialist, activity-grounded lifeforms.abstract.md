# Non-essentialist, activity-grounded lifeforms

If we're looking for the grounds for a notion of lifeform in Spinoza's system, it might seem that the natural place to look, given his ontology, would be in the morphology of bodies, with action and ethics in turn grounded in that lifeform. Spinoza rejects anything like substantial forms that might be capable of imparting something like a species essence to individual things; if there's a difference between, e.g., humans and horses to be found, it makes sense to look for it in the seemingly obvious morphological differences. On such an interpretation, a horse has, and acts on, a specifically "equine lust" (E3p57s) just because it has a specifically equine morphology; similarly, humans are what's most useful for humans, and the activities of a human maximally "agree"  with the activities of other humans (E4p35c1), just because of their shared human morphology. A morphology-grounded reading, however, runs into serious issues when faced with Spinoza's treatment of bodies, chiefly because his ontology lacks the resources for a sufficiently robust speciation of morphologies.

In this chapter, I argue instead for an activity-grounded conception of lifeform. On this conception, lifeforms are constituted through agreement in activity â€“ it's not that human activities agree *because* they are grounded in a human morphology; rather, it's that certain activities are human *just insofar as* they all agree. The activities at stake are multiply realizable through the morphological level, allowing for a notion of lifeform that's compatible with Spinoza's continuism about morphology. Agreement in activity provides Spinoza with a concrete (if, admittedly, underexplained) ground for lifeform, and avoids the issues that come from looking to morphology to do the job. I argue that an activity-grounded reading tracks Spinoza's use of lifeform-related concepts, and that it results in a treatment of lifeforms as dynamic, mutable, and non-essentialist.
